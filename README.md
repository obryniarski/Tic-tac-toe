**Tic Tac Toe**

This is my _first_ attempt at version control.


I will first create a board data type constructor 
and selector. Then functions which check for a win.

Once I have these in place, I can create a running 
game, running through each player's turn and using the 
function created to check for a win each turn.

After finishing the text-based version, I may venture
towards pygame or another method of visualization.

Then maybe I'll program an AI to play against. 
(yay machine learning)
